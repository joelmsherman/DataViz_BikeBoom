# Makeover Monday (MoM) - Week 1, 2021
**Bike Boom in 2020**

## MoM Background
Makeover Monday is a weekly learning and development opportunity to work with a given data set and create better, more effective visualizations.  The goal with MoM is to make information more accessible, and participants are from around the world.  MoM is sponsored by Tableau.  Each week, sponsors post a visualization to be improved, along with a dataset for the original visualization.  Participants then make and share their vizs and the community gets smarter and more creative as a whole!

## Source Article and Viz
This week's Viz: Week 1 of 2021 brings [a viz]() showing 2019 and 2020 weekly bike counts. 

## Data Source
Data is sourced from the Rails to Trails Conservancy [here](https://www.railstotrails.org/COVID19/#trailcount)

## My Approach for Week 46
The original visualization was extremely generic, boring, hard to look at.  I changed the color palette to that of my favorite bike clothing company, and incorporated some design elements to make the message stand out; that the COVID-19 pandemic separated us from each other, but brought us closer to our bicycles.
